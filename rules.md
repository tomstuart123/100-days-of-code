# Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## Main Commitment
**I will push code to this repo everyday for the next 100 days.**
**
#### Start Date
May 12th, 2024.

## Secondary Rules
1. Try and code for 1 hour a day
2. I will cast about my progress every day -> using the hashtag /100days on Farcaster
3. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count
