# Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## Main Commitment
**I will try to push code to this repo everyday for the next 100 days.**

If I don't push code due to a bug, I'll at least try to push notes as to what I've learned

**
#### Start Date
May 12th, 2024.

## Secondary Rules
1. Try and code for 1 hour a day
2. Try to cast semi-regularly about my progress -> using /100daysofcode on Farcaster
3. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count 

Thanks to this (https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code) for inspiration and feel free to also fork their repo to start yourself
